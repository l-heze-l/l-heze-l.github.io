# My Portfolio Webpage
This project is a personal portfolio so that I can show off my projects to my family, friends, and anyone else who is interested. 
I'm making it as both a way to organize my progress as an engineer and a way for me to learn the basics of wab development. 
My sources of information are the tutorials on MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) and the occasional help from AI chatrooms when I am stuck.
My intention is to get the webpage through github.io
